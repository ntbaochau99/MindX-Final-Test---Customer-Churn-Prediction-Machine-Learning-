# MindX Final Test: Customer Churn Prediction (Machine Learning)
**Project Description:**
In this project, I worked with transactional customer data from a multinational bank (ABC Bank) to address the critical business challenge of customer churn. Acting as a Data Analyst, I analyzed customer behavior and service usage patterns to support the Board of Directors in understanding the drivers of churn and identifying customers at risk of discontinuing services in the near future.

The primary objective was to develop a machine learning–based predictive model that estimates the likelihood of customer churn versus retention. The model’s outputs are intended to support the Strategy team in forecasting churn volume and designing targeted retention initiatives to improve customer loyalty and long-term business sustainability.
